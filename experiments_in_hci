Self-reported measurements for task performance can sometimes differ
from objectively measured values. This is due to the subjective
perception of the experiment by each participant. Therefore, it is
recommended to use a mixture of the two and thus achieve a balanced
result.

The advantages of a research hypothesis include its close connection
to theory. Thus, they help to summarize previous work and thus provide
an orientation to motivate and design one's own work. In addition,
their structure can help to report an experiment more easily.
They help to formulate a research question by bringing clarity to
the research issue.

Limitations of research hypotheses are the biases they can create.
They make you focus on a particular issue. Thus they can be an
obstacle for other interesting results, because one concentrates
too much only on the hypotheses. Moreover, one runs the risk of
formulating the null hypothesis only so that one can reject it.
However, one could sometimes conclude more interesting results if
something is wrong and thus benefit from it to learn from it.
