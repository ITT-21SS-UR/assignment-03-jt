Our hypothesis was, that the more mentally demanding second condition would give worse results on reaction time and correctness but we can’t confirm that. The scatterplot shows, that there are two wrong inputs for the first condition and three for the second, just a very small difference. The reaction time for the second condition is even better than for the first one. In general, the participants pressed the corresponding keys quickly, the majority of the results are under 2.5 seconds, however, there are more outliers upwards in the first condition than in the second one. \n",
