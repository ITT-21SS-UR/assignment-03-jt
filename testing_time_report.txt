During testing we noticed two things which could be improved in further studies:
1.	The explanation of the study was only available in English, just like the color names. Therefore it was difficult
for subjects to understand the exactly what they had to do and further explanations or translations were required
2.	After pressing the right key, the next color or color/text appeared. Since the appearance was randomized, the same
combinations could appear several times in a row. It was not always obvious whether the program reacted to the
keystroke and the same combination just happened to appear again, or whether it did not react. This was often
confusing for the subjects, as they did not know whether to press the button again or wait for a reaction.
