a.
The advantage of using a direct point device is that you can directly point/touch the destination you want to change
instead of having to use an external device as a mouse to transfer the input to the device. It is therefore easier and
you don’t need the focus on something outside the device because the f.e. finger is at the same physical position as
the destination and no mentally translation between the hand and the computer to change something inside of the device
as with a mouse or touchpad is needed. Also the movement of a cursor moved my the mouse is usually different from the
actual mouse movement so that also needs to be mentally translated.  But sometime it also doesn’t make sense to use a
direct pointing device as for example of you want to show something in front of a group. When transferring the screen
to a large wall it is impossible to operate it with touch, there the use of an indirect pointing device as a computer
mouse or the touchpad is suitable.

b.
I would say “Shift” is a direct (the finger points directly at the destination and is at the same physical position),
absolute (the position of the pointer on screen is consistent with the location of input device),
isometric (is measures the force of the touch)

In the study they used an IPAQ PDA with the screen size of 550x730mm
