For our experiment, six people were tested. Due to different ages and different skills in using the computer the
results were different and we also encountered different issues with the tasks.
The limitation was that the explanation of the study was only available in English, just like the color names.
Therefore it was difficult for subjects to understand completely what they had to do and further explanations or
translations were required.
During testing we noticed one thing which could be improved in further studies, after pressing the right key, the
next color or color/text appeared. Since the appearance was randomized, the same combinations could appear several
times in a row. It was not always obvious whether the program reacted to the keystroke and the same combination just
happened to appear again, or whether it did not react. This was often confusing for the subjects, as they did not know
whether to press the button again or wait for a reaction.
Our participants where of different age and hat different skills with using the computer. Due to the lack of a
questionnaire on these data, they could unfortunately not be taken into account in the later evaluation.
This could be improved in further studies.
